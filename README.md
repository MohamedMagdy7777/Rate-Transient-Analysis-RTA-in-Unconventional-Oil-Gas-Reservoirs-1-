Rate Transient Analysis (RTA) in Unconventional Oil &amp; Gas Reservoirs 




INTRODUCTION


Production from unconventional petroleum reservoirs includes petroleum from 
shale, coal, tight-sand and oil-sand. These reservoirs contain enormous quantities of oil 
and natural gas but pose a technology challenge to both geoscientists and engineers to 
produce economically on a commercial scale. These reservoirs store large volumes and 
are widely distributed at different stratigraphic levels and basin types, offering long-term 
potential for energy supply. Most of these reservoirs are low permeability and porosity 
that need enhancement with hydraulic fracture stimulation to maximize fluid drainage. 
Production from these reservoirs is increasing with continued advancement in geological 
characterization techniques and technology for well drilling, logging, and completion with 
drainage enhancement. Currently, Australia, Argentina, Canada, Egypt, USA, and 
Venezuela are producing natural gas from low permeability reservoirs: tight-sand, shale, 
and coal (CBM). Canada, Russia, USA, and Venezuela are producing heavy oil from oil 
sands. USA is leading the development of techniques for exploring, and technology for 
exploiting unconventional gas resources, which can help to develop potential gas-bearing 
shales of Thailand.
In this project, I will investigate a dataset containing examples of the geological 
features of unconventional reservoirs such as 'Porosity (%)', 'Acoustic impedance 
(kg/m2s*10^6)', 'Brittleness Ratio', 'Vitrinite Reflectance (%)' and understand their 
relationship among each other, their significance and their relationship with the production 
of the reservoir ùê¥‚àöùêæ which is simply the cross-sectional area multiplied by the square root 
of permeability

DESCRIPTION OF THE DATASET


The Dataset has the following features 'Porosity (%)', 'Acoustic impedance 
(kg/m2s*10^6)', 'Brittleness Ratio', 'Vitrinite Reflectance (%)' and the target feature is 
the ùê¥‚àöùêæ Aroot(K) as shown in Figure 1

Figure 1 : Sample of the geological dataset


Porosity is a measure of the void spaces in a material, and is a fraction of the volume 
of voids over the total volume, between 0 and 1, or as a percentage between 0% and 
100%


Matrix Perm ‚ÄúMatrix Permeability‚Äù is one of the most important parameters for 
characterizing a source rock reservoir and for predicting hydrocarbon production. The 
low permeability value and the presence of induced fractures during core retrieval and 
transportation make the accurate measurement of the true permeability values for 
source rocks a significant challenge for the industry


Acoustic impedance are measures of the opposition that a system presents to the 
acoustic flow resulting from an acoustic pressure applied to the system.


Brittleness Ratio is the ratio of uniaxial compressive strength to tensile strength.


TOC ‚ÄúTotal Organic Carbon‚Äù is the amount of carbon found in an organic compound 
and is often used as a non-specific indicator of water quality or cleanliness of 
pharmaceutical manufacturing equipment. TOC may also refer to the amount of organic 
carbon in soil, or in a geological formation, particularly the source rock for a petroleum 
play;


Vitrinite Reflectance is the proportion of incident light reflected from a polished vitrinite 
surface.
ùë®‚àöùë≤ is a productivity metric obtained from rate transient analysis (RTA) in 
unconventional reservoirs and it is equivalent to kh in conventional reservoirs. AOK is 
simply the cross-sectional area multiplied by the square root of permeability
From the dataset we can observe that all features including the target / output feature is 
numeric and that there are no categorical features.


OBJECTIVE


‚Ä¢ Understand the dataset and the features
‚Ä¢ Feature engineer the features if required
‚Ä¢ Predict the production of unconventional reservoirs using different regression 
models


‚Ä¢ Evaluate the performance of regression models using 3 cross-validation splits
‚Ä¢ Interpret feature importance
‚Ä¢ Identify flaws in the model and formulate a plan.


PLAN


Python, seaborn, pandas and numpy will be the tools used to conduct the Exploratory 
Data Analysis, First we will use the .describe() function to understand the dataset more, 
know the mean, standard deviation, minimum values, maximum values, medians for 
each features.

Techniques to apply


‚Ä¢ Histogram and density plots to check if there are skewed data
‚Ä¢ Boxplots to check features that might have outliers
‚Ä¢ Scatter plots will be used to understand the relationship between a feature and 
another
‚Ä¢ Heatmap plot to check if there are any features that are linearly correlated

INSIGHTS

From the Histogram and Density plots shown in Figure 2, we can see that all features 
including the target feature are normally distributed, however Matrix Perm (nd) has a 
positive skew, Brittleness ratio and TOC has a negative skew

From the Boxplot as shown below in Figure 3, Outliers exist in the Matrix Permeability 
feature as well as the Vitrinite Reflectance Feature, this can be treated by transforming 
the features

![boxplot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118182347/214058105-dfe9d151-66f8-4720-97f2-a50e86704d20.png)


From the pair plot shown in Figure 4, we can observe that Porosity, Matrix Perm are 
strongly correlated with the target feature Aroot(K), we can also observe that Porosity and 
Matrix Perm are linearly correlated, TOC and Porosity are also linearly correlated, this 
means that we can drop the Matrix Perm and TOC columns as they will not provide 
significant value

DATA CLEANING & FEATURE ENGINEERING


As observed in the pair plot Porosity and Matrix Perm are linearly correlated, TOC and 
Porosity are also linearly correlated, However we want to quantify the Correlation thus 
we will use the pearson correlation, a threshold we will set is that features that have a 
person number above 0.7 will be considered linearly correlated and can be dropped 
from the dataframe. 
Using the Heatmap function from the seaborn library as shown in Figure 5, we can 
observe that TOC and Porosity have a pearson correlation number of 0.71, and Matrix 
Perm and Porosity have a pearson correlation number of 0.76, this means these 
features are linearly correlated and we can drop any of these features.

Dropping Features

We will drop the Matrix Permeability and the TOC feature as they are already linearly 
correlated with the Porosity feature

We can observe that the new set of features are: 

1. Porosity
2. Acoustic Impedance
3. Brittleness Ratio
4. Vitrinite Reflectance


Scaling


We can also observe that we need to scale the features as there are big differences 
between the values of Brittleness Ratio column and Vitrinite Reflectance column.
We will use the MinMax scaler from the sklearn library to scale the features so that they 
are between the values (0 and 1)

REGRESSION MODELS

First, I have created the X and y dataframes that will be used to train different 
linear regression models

![Screenshot 2023-01-23 160714](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118182347/214059767-f3b10cd5-2778-4537-9368-910d5d016978.png)

Following that I created sklearn pipelines Linear Regression, Lasso Regression 
and Ridge Regression which would scale the training set first.

Following that I have used KFlod cross validation (3 splits) to make sure I have 
robust predictions and used cross_val_predict to predict the target feature using 
Linear Regression, Lasso Regression and Ridge Regression


![Screenshot 2023-01-23 160914](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118182347/214060218-4404836b-8299-4ac5-9c1f-8b6dd6c44155.png)

The R2 Score of each regression model is as following

![Screenshot 2023-01-23 161023](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118182347/214060405-65e6a288-a5bf-4e44-8807-1db21096c963.png)

Where Linear Regression and Ridge regression obtained the best r2 score at 0.9337 
and 0.9328 respectively

The Scatter plots is as following:

![Screenshot 2023-01-23 161200](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118182347/214060775-44825f25-f089-4fb5-892a-7e6a8d81089c.png)

To achieve better accuracy, I have implemented polynomial transformation of 
features in the pipeline.

![Screenshot 2023-01-23 161317](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118182347/214061072-4e178fc0-6996-4cd1-9bc8-970469c5b1af.png)


The R2 Scores of the Regression models after using Polynomial features is as 
following


![Screenshot 2023-01-23 161402](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118182347/214061259-917e98cd-9571-48a7-84ae-194af2fae39f.png)

We can observe that r2 score increase significantly after implementing polynomial 
transformation.

The scatter plots of the Regression models after using Polynomial features is as 
following

![Screenshot 2023-01-23 161514](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118182347/214061506-bae549a1-64d4-4179-8b52-c9bace16a967.png)

Therefore, I have chosen Linear Regression with Polynomial transformation (2 Degrees) 
since it has the best R2 Score

Key Findings

Looking at the coefficients on the Linear Regression model, we can find that the most 
important features are Brittleness Ratio and Porosity.

Next Steps


Adding more features such as the Reynold numbers, fracture rate, pressure, mass of the 
gas, number of gas moles, specific gravity of the reservoir, wet gas temperatures can 
help us build a more solid model that is able to predict production rates more accurately 
and will make us more confident in our regression model predictions
