Rate Transient Analysis (RTA) in Unconventional Oil &amp; Gas Reservoirs 




INTRODUCTION


Production from unconventional petroleum reservoirs includes petroleum from 
shale, coal, tight-sand and oil-sand. These reservoirs contain enormous quantities of oil 
and natural gas but pose a technology challenge to both geoscientists and engineers to 
produce economically on a commercial scale. These reservoirs store large volumes and 
are widely distributed at different stratigraphic levels and basin types, offering long-term 
potential for energy supply. Most of these reservoirs are low permeability and porosity 
that need enhancement with hydraulic fracture stimulation to maximize fluid drainage. 
Production from these reservoirs is increasing with continued advancement in geological 
characterization techniques and technology for well drilling, logging, and completion with 
drainage enhancement. Currently, Australia, Argentina, Canada, Egypt, USA, and 
Venezuela are producing natural gas from low permeability reservoirs: tight-sand, shale, 
and coal (CBM). Canada, Russia, USA, and Venezuela are producing heavy oil from oil 
sands. USA is leading the development of techniques for exploring, and technology for 
exploiting unconventional gas resources, which can help to develop potential gas-bearing 
shales of Thailand.
In this project, I will investigate a dataset containing examples of the geological 
features of unconventional reservoirs such as 'Porosity (%)', 'Acoustic impedance 
(kg/m2s*10^6)', 'Brittleness Ratio', 'Vitrinite Reflectance (%)' and understand their 
relationship among each other, their significance and their relationship with the production 
of the reservoir ùê¥‚àöùêæ which is simply the cross-sectional area multiplied by the square root 
of permeability
